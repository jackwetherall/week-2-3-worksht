    <h1>Have you ever made a pizza from scratch?</h1>
    <h2>Yeah, but have you really thought about it?</h2>
    <h3>Like, how if you put the sauce on first, before you make the base it doesn't work?</h3>
    <h4>Or, if you put the cheese on then the sauce it's messed up too</h4>
    <h5 class="special">This is how you make a pizza</h5>
    <p class="special">
    Making pizza is similar to coding. There are certain things 
    we have to do first. like making the base, letting it rise,
     mould the base out, add the sauce, add the toppings, add the
      cheese, bake, and cut and serve. Not all pizzas end up the same, 
      but they do stsart out in the same way as long as you follow the 
      order correctly. You can have everyything you need to make different
       pizzas using the same base structure that is set up before hand.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>make the pizza base</li>
        <li>add the comato sauce</li>
        <li>add the <em>yummy</em> toppings</li>
        <li>add the cheese</li>
        <li>bake</li>
        <li>cut</li>
        <li>serve</li>

    </ol>

    <h3>The toppings are different, they change for every occasion and taste. There is no order to toppings, So we will list them like this:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Pepperoni</li>
        <li class="fave">Olives</li>
        <li class="fave">Mushrooms</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li class="fave" >Peppers <strong>we NEVER discriminate on colours of Peppers</strong></li>
        <li class="fave" >Jalapenos</li>
        <li>Pinapple</li>
        <li>Bacon</li>
        <li><small>all vegan btw</small></li>

    <ul>
